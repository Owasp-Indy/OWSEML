Examples for Interchange 

as well as a place to brain-storm/dartboard/purpose ideas about the main project , and get ideas down for now, and thik of a long term storage of security events, and XML is used already in SQL and python, etc & likely for Cassandra /Hadoop 

xml some dislike however it is structured, IDEA is to keep it <event> <id=event#> Device-id device-name (canonacol nme of device/locality etc
day/time timezone etc. 
software-id  <capture-data>url binary ethernet or other data raw hear.  </capture-data>

for now I am dart boarding ideas.
